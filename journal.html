<h1>My Journal Entries!</h1>
<p>Hello everybody, this is my first journal entry.</p>
<p>I love the Knicks</p>

<p>Journal Entry #2: Helpful Things for Terminal (Notes)s</p>
<p>ls -> Lists things in your folder</p>
<p>git status -> In your website folder, it tells us what we have changed (green = you've already added, red = changed but not yet added</p>
<p>cd ./desktop/ ___.github.io</p>
<p>git add . = adds all your changes,  git commit - m "." = write a message/comment to show what you've done    git push = publishes your website</p>

<p> Journal Entry #3 - Work on Website</p> 
<p>I just worked on cleaning up my index and just making it look a lot better, as well as making all of my pages look more similar and more like they're all on the same website. I really like the way my index/home page looks so far, since it looks really clean, but I think I can make it even better since I have a few ideas. Other than that, not much as happened, but I am going to check over everything and then push it to my website.</p>


<p>Journal Entry #4 - Event Listener</p>
<p>Today in class we worked on event listeners, and how websites can respond to an action that is done on the computer. We only did simple things, like seeing things things happening in the console, but I have some ideas. I was wondering exactly what you could do when it comes to "listeners": Can you play audio? Can you go to another website? </p>

<p>Journal Entry #5 - Jump Scare!</p>
<p>Today, I started my Jump Scare project. I have a few ideas, but I think I want to include my friend, Julian, in my project. I also want it to be scary, and I don't have any scary photos of him, so I think it might be a little difficult making it scare someone. Hopefully, I can do something paired with audio that will make someone scared.</p>

<p>Journal Entry #6 - Questions</p>
<p>1.Why, in the beginning of the video when looking at the console, does it show all of that information? Is it really needed?   2. What do the rgb values mean? 3. Also, what do things like borderBlockstart, and borderBlockStartColor mean for example?

<p>Journal Entry #7 - Appreciation</p>
<p>For my appreciation card, I made one dedicated to my family. It says I LOVE YOU on the top, and a red color for the background. I used an event listener to listen for my click, and once it heard it, it turned all of my picture's opacities to 1, as it was 0 before. I have 5 pictures in total, me with each of my family members individually, and one with all of us, including my Grandma. I am thinking of adding a song to the background once you click, but I'm not really sure what song to do yet.</p>

<p>Journal Entry #8 - Holiday Gift: Jersey Maker</p>
<p>I made a jersey maker with multiple different pictures, so anyone can customize their jersey however they want. I didn't really make it for anyone in particular, even thought it is a holiday gift, but I made it basketball/knicks themed, as per my website. It was really tedious to paste in all of the pictures from the internet.</p>

<p>Journal Entry #9 - Spirit Knicks Player:</p>
<p>Today, and this past few classes, we worked on array, using a random # and assigning specific variables or values to words or pictures so that things come up randomly. I made it so there was a list of the Knicks players, a picture of them individually, and a personality that is similar to theirs that would explain your "spirit" personality as well. It worked by having a random number 1-15 that all of the pictures were assigned to, and each time the website was clicked, there was a different trio that was picked based on the number that was rolled. If the number picked was 1, it would display Isaiah Hartenstein's name, a picture of him, and a personality that is a little similar to him. It was the same for each player, and as said before, changed each time the website was clicked. It seems a little bland, so maybe I can change the background in the future, but for right now, I'm really proud of it.</p>

<p>Journal Entry #10 - Baking Presentation via Reveal.js</p>
<p>I created a presentation using reveal.js about my favorite things that I have baked. It was basically just adding divs and transfering pictures over to my computers and linking to them, but it turned out really clean and I'm super happy about the way that it looks. It's cool and different from using a premade slideshow program like Google Slides and it's pretty customizable. Overall, for me at least, it's still easier to use Google Slides as there's so many cool features that are really easy to use, but I think as I get better at coding, there's a chance that I can transfer over to using reveal.js.</p> 

<p>Journal Entry #11 - Colors</p>
<p>This code works by using Math.random, which takes random numbers every time the person clicks the page by using an event listener. There are variables for each value of red, green, and blue which are random from 0-255 and they go into the background-color in the style section each time the document is pressed, again, because of the event listener. In the second version of the code, I console.logged the x and y values and made the red and green values of the rgb to the x and y values of where my mouse was.
