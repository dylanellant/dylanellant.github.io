<h1>My Journal Entries!</h1>
<p>Hello everybody, this is my first journal entry.</p>
<p>I love the Knicks</p>

<p>Journal Entry #2: Helpful Things for Terminal (Notes)</p>
<p>ls -> Lists things in your folder</p>
<p>git status -> In your website folder, it tells us what we have changed (green = you've already added, red = changed but not yet added</p>
<p>cd ./desktop/ ___.github.io</p>
<p>git add . = adds all your changes,  git commit - m "." = write a message/comment to show what you've done    git push = publishes your website</p>

<p> Journal Entry #3 - Work on Website</p> 
<p>I just worked on cleaning up my index and just making it look a lot better, as well as making all of my pages look more similar and more like they're all on the same website. I really like the way my index/home page looks so far, since it looks really clean, but I think I can make it even better since I have a few ideas. Other than that, not much as happened, but I am going to check over everything and then push it to my website.</p>
