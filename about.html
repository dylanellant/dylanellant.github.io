<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Dylan Ellant, and I go to the Dalton School in NYC. I am a part of the class of 2027, and as I am writing this, I am in 9th grade. This is my second experience coding, my first was last year, in CS0, but this is definitely more in depth and also is a lot more fun so far. I hope you enjoy my New York Knicks (the basketball team) themed website. Bye! </p>
